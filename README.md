## Synopsis

This python Flask application allows FTC robotics team to scout other teams and
score matches for the 2016-2017 Velocity Vortex game.

## Motivation

This project is part learning new things and part support of my son's robotics
team (Robo Raiders FTC 7129) for scouting at competitions.

## Installation

1. Clone the project
2. Initialize the db (currently set up as SQLLite)
3. Create your admin user (email/password_hash required)
4. WSGI setup is up to you.

## Contributors

I'm brutally bad at all things front-end, so the html, css, and js is all
a Shakespearean tragedy. Happy to accept pointers on how to make all that more
efficient and cleaner.

## License

No license. It's a free for all! Just happy to be coding.
